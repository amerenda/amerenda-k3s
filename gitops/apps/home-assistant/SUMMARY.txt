Home Assistant Lighting Control â€” Patched Unified DRY Package (with dynamic brightness helpers)

Switch blueprint now supports optional per-room brightness helpers:
- input_number.<room>_brightness_step_pct
- input_number.<room>_min_brightness_pct
- input_number.<room>_max_brightness_pct

If these are provided in the blueprint inputs, the switch uses them live; otherwise it falls back to the
static 'Fallback brightness step (%)' and 1%/100% for min/max.

Everything else remains as in the previous patched package.
