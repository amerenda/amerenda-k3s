    Home Assistant Orphaned Entity Cleanup Script
    
    This script identifies and removes orphaned entities from Home Assistant.
    Orphaned entities are those that are no longer being provided by their integration
    (typically showing "restored: true" in attributes).
    
    Supports cleanup of helper entities (input_*) and schedule entities.
    
    Initially runs in dry-run mode for safety.
