Add this view to your Lovelace dashboard
------------------------------------
Option A (YAML mode):
- Append 'ui-lovelace.yaml' with the view below (or use '!include' to keep it modular).

Option B (Storage UI mode):
- Go to Dashboards > Three dots > Raw configuration editor > Paste under 'views:'

View YAML is in: dashboards/lovelace/views/living_room_lighting.yaml
